;;; The specification of the typeout is somewhat lacking. A typeout is
;;; estabilished to introduce a hint in the input editor, for example:
;;;
;;; - show available commands after pressing [tab] in the interactor
;;; - show the function arglist or its documentation during typing
;;;
;;; When ERASE is NIL, then "old" typeout may be retained, otherwise it must be
;;; removed. To "remove" the typeout just supply an empty body and :ERASE T.
;;; When the typeout shares the output record with the input editor, then erase
;;; may be important
;;;
;;; The specification says that FRESH-LINE should be called before and after the
;;; evaluating the body - that strongly suggests that the input editor should be
;;; redrawn (vertically) below the typeout, however this should be up to the
;;; method - i.e we may want to show a tooltip instead, or use the pointer
;;; documentation pane when available. -- jd 2022-07-20
