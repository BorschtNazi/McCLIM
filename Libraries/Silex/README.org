Silex is a library inspired by Silica and SDL2 - libraries that are meant to
provide an access to the underlying hardware in a portable fashion. This code
is derived from the McCLIM codebase to allow building GUI toolkits following
different paradigms than CLIM.

* Overview

1. System Interface

The System Interface Substrate implements lisp utilities, abstractions and
portability layers for the system (like networking and multithreading).

2. Geometry and Math Utilities

The Geometry Substrate implements regions, region sets and operations on
them. Additionally it exports math utilities relevant to processing grapahics.
   
3. Drawing Substrate

The Drawing Substrate proposes the model for rendering graphics and the
software renderer that implements them.

4. Windowing Substrate

The Windowing Substrate implements managing windows and and defines the model
for handling the I/O for a display server.

* Non-goals

Silex does not provide any sort of widgets or composition panes. This is the
responsibility of a toolkit written on top of it. Only the system itnerface,
input and output.
